Sass Toolkit
============

Sass Toolkit makes developing websites with Sass easier. There are 2 parts of the Sass Toolkit:

1.  **Reset.** The reset removes the browser default styles and fixes various quirks to give developers a consistent starting point when building websites.
2.  **Tools.** The tools are provided to get you up and running faster. A bunch of variables and mixins have been created to deal with common CSS code patterns such as clearfix, generated content, and browser prefixes.

Built for mobile & responsive
-----------------------------

Sass Toolkit has been specifically built for for mobile and responsive sites that are aimed at modern browsers. It uses the `border-box` box model, and out of the box you get responsive images which look great on any sized device, support for HTML5, and mixins for common CSS3 patterns.

Using Sass Toolkit
------------------

To recompile the toolkit Sass -> css for the test page:

    sass --watch test/sass/:test/css/

Browser Support
---------------

Not sure, Iâ€™ve done limited testing. My guess is IE8+ and the rest.
